04F: @Then how about for $[03 1E]?[BREAK][END]
050: @Yeah, I don't blame you.[BREAK][PAUSE]It doesn't even know any[BREAK]songs.[BREAK][END]
051: @Thanks! Take extra good[BREAK]care of it![BREAK][END]
052: @How about for free, then?[BREAK]C'mon, take it.[BREAK][END]
053: @Say, how's that canary[BREAK]doing?[BREAK][END]
054: @I'm almost certain that[BREAK]something is controlling[BREAK]all the animals...[BREAK][END]
055: @Animals are so cute. Don't[BREAK]you agree?[BREAK][END]
056: @Teehee.[BREAK][END]
057: @Stupid head![BREAK][END]
058: @Welcome! Do you need to[BREAK]return any items?[BREAK][END]

05A: @Whew, what a relief.[BREAK][END]
05B: @Please visit us again for[BREAK]all your shopping needs![BREAK](giggle)[BREAK][END]
05C: @It's nice that there's a[BREAK]machine on the first floor[BREAK]of the department store[BREAK][PAUSE]that lets you withdraw cash[BREAK]from your bank account,[BREAK][PAUSE]but you need a PTA card or[BREAK]something to use it.[BREAK][PAUSE]That's not very convenient,[BREAK]if you ask me.[BREAK][END]
05D: 
05E: @It's such nice weather out.[BREAK][PAUSE]But what does it matter?[END]
05F: @Oh, that canary is Laura[BREAK]the songbird's baby![BREAK][PAUSE]@Go take it to her![BREAK][END]
060: @You seem to have forgotten[BREAK]something important about[BREAK]life.[BREAK][PAUSE]How sad.[BREAK][END]
061: @Now where did I last see[BREAK]Laura...?[BREAK][END]
062: @It sounds like Laura the[BREAK]songbird has remembered her[BREAK]song.[BREAK][PAUSE]@Have you learned her[BREAK]melody, too?[BREAK][END]
063: @Well, that's no good.[BREAK][END]
064: @In song there is strength.[BREAK][PAUSE]True words, indeed.[BREAK][END]
065: @I'm Pippi. I'm lost.[BREAK]You're really brave, huh?[BREAK][END]

06D: @Kyakyakya![BREAK](You're a big doo-doo[BREAK]head!)[BREAK][END]
06E: @[03 16] heard a voice...[BREAK][PAUSE]@"Where is the god's tail?"[BREAK][END]
06F: @Whoa, those are some weird[BREAK]clothes you have on there.[BREAK][PAUSE]@I bet you'll attract[BREAK]monsters dressed like that![BREAK][END]
070: 
071: @Happiness won't just walk[BREAK]into your life on its own.[BREAK][PAUSE]@But neither will[BREAK]unhappiness.[BREAK][PAUSE]@Wouldn't you agree?[BREAK][END]
072: @So if you don't want[BREAK]trouble in your life...[BREAK][PAUSE]then you'd best stay still[BREAK]and never move a muscle.[BREAK][END]
073: @Really? Unhappiness CAN[BREAK]walk?[BREAK][PAUSE]I had no idea.[BREAK][END]
074: @So, you admit I have good[BREAK]taste?[BREAK][PAUSE]@Then I take it you want a[BREAK]cool nickname, too?[BREAK][END]
075: @Okay, I got it.[BREAK][PAUSE]@From now on, your name will[BREAK]be Stupid Face [03 16].[BREAK][PAUSE]@It just oozes class.[BREAK][END]

07E: @I feel completely refreshed[BREAK]after stopping by Queen[BREAK]Mary's fountain![BREAK][END]
07F: @Gettng to Queen Mary's[BREAK]fountain is really tough.[BREAK][PAUSE]Not only is it far away,[BREAK]but it's hard to find, too.[BREAK][END]
080: @I'm going to take this[BREAK]broken earring to the[BREAK]fountain to turn it into a[BREAK]magic earring.[BREAK][END]
081: @I feel so relaxed just[BREAK]listening to the mysterious[BREAK]sound of the fountain.[BREAK][END]
082: @Oh, are you lost?[BREAK]Just keep going south.[BREAK][PAUSE]@Oops, sorry. I thought you[BREAK]were looking for a[BREAK]restroom.[BREAK][PAUSE]@If you're looking for Queen[BREAK]Mary's fountain, then just[BREAK]go west from the castle.[BREAK][END]
083:

088: @Great![BREAK][END]
089: @Waaah! You're supposed to[BREAK]accept people's kindness![END]
08A: @Oh, a traveler! Why don't[BREAK]you eat with us?[BREAK][PAUSE]@Here, can you guess what[BREAK]we're having today?[BREAK][END]
08B: @Huh? Why can't you tell?[BREAK]You're really suspicious![BREAK][END]
08C: @That's right, [03 15].[BREAK][PAUSE]@I read your mind and[BREAK]decided to make [03 15].[BREAK][PAUSE]@How does it taste? Do you[BREAK]like it?[BREAK][END]
08D: 
08E: 
08F: @I used to run a musical[BREAK]instrument store, but the[BREAK]ocarina I ordered never [BREAK]arrived.[BREAK][PAUSE]@So I've given up.[BREAK][END]
