"damage" : 10,   # Base value used to calculate damage/healing. Currently works as follows (subject to change):

                 # if not healing and not item: (damage + int) - (enemyDefense * 0.5) = finalDamage
                 # if healing and psi: (damage + int) = finalHealing
                 # if not healing and item: damage - (enemyDefense * 0.5) = finalDamage
