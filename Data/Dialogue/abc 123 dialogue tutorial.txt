this will be updated regularly when we add more stuff to the system, text should be a json file and look smth like this
'0':
	type: normal
	text: Hello World!

you can add other entries, keep in mind they always have to be stringed numbers ('0' '1' '2', '10')

when you have multiple entries you have to add a "goto" in each index (goto: '1')

you can also set the npcs name by adding "name" (name: Ben)

set the sound of the dialogue by doing "sound: Adult", current list of sounds are:
============
Adult
Kid
Robot
Strange
Sexy
Shy
============


theres also "type" to set the index as normal dialogue or dialogue with questions
speaking of questions when you have a dialogue set as a question add the code below to an index
==========
options:
	Yes: '2'
	No: '3'

==========
basically choosing yes will set the dialogue to the index 2 dialogue and choosing no will bring you to the index 3 dialogue, you can also set the options to other words other than yes and no, you can have 3 options too!

you can make the screen shake by adding "shake" and then the magnitude being
==========
'small'
'medium'
'big'

theres "emoteplayer" and "emotenpc", these will summon emote bubble boxes on top of an npc or a player, current reaction list is (the list will be updated too when we add more options):
============
'dot'
'surprise'
'shock'
'question'
'heart'
============
